# Text-Editor
A small project done during a C#/.NET course at Karlstads university.

A simple text-editor that allows the user to save and load their documents in .txt format.

What I Learned:
- How to use different kinds of dialog boxes in Windows Forms, such as dialogs to save and load files.
- Using the Path-class and its function to simplify working with filepaths as strings.
- Handling Drag-and-Drop of files to a Windows Forms RichTextBox.
- How to precisely calculate details of the document, such as number of rows and words, so
that these details can be displayed to the user.
